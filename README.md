# USDA-PowerBI-Dashboard
This project demonstrates the use of Python for ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) processes and Power BI for data visualization. It focuses on analyzing data related to the adoption of genetically modified crops in the U.S. over the past two decades.

## Features
- **ETL Process in Python**:
  - Extraction of raw data from a multi-sheet Excel file.
  - Transformation into a unified and structured dataset using Pandas.
  - Export of cleaned data to a new Excel file.
- **Interactive Dashboard in Power BI**:
  - Insights on crop adoption trends by state and year.
  - Key metrics calculated using DAX, such as average adoption rates and annual growth trends.

## Dataset
The dataset was obtained from the USDA Economic Research Service, detailing genetically engineered crop adoption rates by state and gene type.

## Technologies Used
- **Python**: Data extraction and transformation with Pandas.
- **Power BI**: Dashboard design and visualization.

## Key Learnings
This project enhanced my skills in data cleaning, feature engineering, and interactive reporting. It highlights how ETL workflows can seamlessly integrate with business intelligence tools to deliver actionable insights.
